				I make games, and well, pixel art. I currently use Unity for making games, 
				I've used Game Maker, Phaser and HaxeFlixel in the past.
				FACT: Aesprite is shit, PyxelEdit's much better.
				ANOTHER FACT: Liverpool fans are heartless, they actually pickpocketed the dead people. 
				              It's always their fault but they're ashamed of nothing.
